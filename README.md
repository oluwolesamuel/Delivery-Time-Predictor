# Delivery-Time-Predictor
This a simple project that visualizes and analyses delivery time data from restaurants, and evaluates the factors that are most influential in determining how quickly food orders are delivered to customers.

This project was carried out using Jupyter notebook in Python. The dataset which is also uploaded is pretty clean, there are no missing values or entries.
Various Python libraries were used in implementing this project, Pandas, Numpy, MatPlotLib, SKlearn.
The project invloves some visualisation of the various attributes contained in the dataset, and regression plots were done to determine which varriables were most influential in the delivery time of orders. Visualizations were also produced to evaluate the most common order and vehicle types just for fun. Visualizations were also done to find out how the vehicle type and order type influences the delivery time, however their average values were close enough that we can conclude they were not influential.
The ML model was trained using a simple multivariate regression model obtained from the SKlearn library in Python, you can feel free to use your own model if you like.
The project also contains a section that allows you to enter variables, and then produces a predicted time for when your order will arrive.

I do hope you enjoy going through this project and possibly implementing it yourself. Feel free to contact me on olumeka@gmail.com or leave remarks about the project.
Thanks!
